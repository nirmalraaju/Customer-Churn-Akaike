Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

Built a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn and identify key drivers of attrition. After preprocessing and feature engineering, Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (~86% accuracy). The analysis found that age, salary, credit score, balance, and number of products are major factors influencing churn. These insights can help banks implement targeted retention strategies and proactive customer engagement.
